Task 5 Summary

In this task, I created a new database for a fictional pharmaceutical sales company, "PharmaPlus," to serve as a practical example for learning SQL joins.

This database consists of four tables:

SalesReps

Products

Customers

Sales

I populated these tables with sample data, including strategic edge cases like a sales rep with no sales (Sunita Sharma), a product that has never been sold (Glimenclamide), and a customer with no purchases (Wellness Forever). These cases are essential for clearly demonstrating the difference between INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins.

The main file, task_5_joins.sql, is structured as a "level-up" learning guide. It starts with the schema creation and data insertion, then progresses through a series of join examples, from the most basic INNER JOIN to more complex topics.

The guide covers:

Level 1: INNER JOIN (Finding matches)

Level 2: LEFT JOIN (Showing all reps, even those with no sales)

Level 3: RIGHT JOIN (Showing all products, even those unsold)

Level 4: FULL OUTER JOIN (Including the emulation for MySQL/SQLite)

Level 5: Multi-Table Joins (Creating a full report by chaining joins)

Level 6: CROSS JOIN (Creating a Cartesian product)

Level 7: SELF JOIN (Finding reps in the same region)

This practical guide also serves to demonstrate the concepts from the interview questions (e.g., self-joins, cross-joins, joining more than 2 tables).

Finally, I created separate files (task_5_interview_answers.md and readme.md) to provide the specific deliverables requested.
